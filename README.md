OVERVIEW
--------------

ECS API User Interface is a web application developped in Golang and leveraging AngularJS

The goals of ECSUI are to:

- demonstrate some nice S3 features (versioning, lifecycle policy, …) and several unique ECS capabilities using either the S3, Swift or Atmos API (byte range, retentions, metadata search, …)
- simplify the usage of the S3, Swift, Atmos and ECS Management API
- provide a simple UI for the ECS metadata search features
- provide a simple UI to get metering information from ECS

BUILD
--------------

The Dockerfile can be used to create a Docker container for this web application.

Just run the following command in the folder that contains the Dockerfile: docker build -t ecsui .

RUN
--------------

You can optionaly set environment variables (*USER*, *PASSWORD* and *ENDPOINT*) to let the application using the ECS management API to provide some additional features (like displaying the *Replication Groups* available when creating a bucket).

To start the application, run:
```
docker run -d -p 80:80 djannot/ecsui
```

The application is now available on port 80.
